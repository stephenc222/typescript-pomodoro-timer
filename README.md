# TypeScript Pomodoro Timer

## Overview

A simple pomodoro timer, written in TypeScript and with React

## Features

An interval consisting of 25 minutes work, 5 minutes break. After 4 intervals, 15 minute break. Repeats.
You can reset the whole timer, and pause the timer

_NOTE: the web app version's interval is built with `setInterval`, which loses time when the tab of its
window loses focus and enters inactive state, so the web app is just a demo!_
